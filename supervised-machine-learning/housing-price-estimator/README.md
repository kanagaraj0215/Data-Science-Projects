## Housing Price Estimator

**Project Description:** <br />
This project aims to develop a housing price estimator by leveraging linear regression and decision tree algorithms to predict home prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The project involves preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, categorical data, and outliers, followed by feature selection and engineering to improve model accuracy. Linear regression provides a straightforward approach to model the relationship between features and prices, while the decision tree algorithm captures nonlinear patterns and interactions between features. By comparing the performance of these models, the project seeks to identify the most effective method for accurately estimating housing prices, offering valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
