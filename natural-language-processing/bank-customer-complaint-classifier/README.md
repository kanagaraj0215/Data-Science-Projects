## Bank Customer Complaint Classifier

**Project Description:** <br />
The bank offers multiple financial products, such as credit cards, debit cards, mortgages, and retail banking. The bank receives thousands of disputes and complaints daily via various channels, including emails, phone calls, social media, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), etc. The bank must resolve customer complaints promptly to maintain customer satisfaction in the competitive environment for growth, revenue, and reputation. It is challenging for its customer support team to manually review every complaint and route it to the correct line of business in the bank. It is resource-consuming and time-consuming. Automating customer complaint classification and routing them to the proper team is essential to streamline the process, allowing quicker and more accurate responses and eventually improving customer satisfaction.
