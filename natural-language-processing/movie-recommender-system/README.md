## Movie Recommender System

**Project Description:** <br />
This project focuses on building a movie recommender system using content-based filtering, which suggests movies to users based on the features of movies they have previously liked or rated highly. The system leverages movie metadata to create a profile for each user and recommend movies with similar attributes. By utilizing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to process textual data and compute similarity scores between movies, the recommender system personalizes movie recommendations, enhancing the user experience by offering tailored suggestions based on individual preferences.
