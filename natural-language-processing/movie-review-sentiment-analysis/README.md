## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

**Project Description:** <br />
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews, either positive or negative, providing insights into the overall reception of a movie.

### Getting Started <br />
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

**Data Source** <br />
The data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.
