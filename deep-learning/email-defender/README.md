## Email Defender

**Project Description:** <br />
In the digital age, organizations are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of email communications, with a substantial proportion of spam. This spam not only congests email systems but also poses significant security threats, including phishing and malware attacks. Traditional spam detection methods, often reliant on simplistic keyword-based approaches, frequently fail to accurately distinguish between legitimate and malicious emails, resulting in missed threats or unnecessary filtering of valid messages. As spam tactics become more sophisticated and diverse, there is a critical need for advanced detection systems capable of adapting to these evolving threats and improving overall email security and efficiency.
