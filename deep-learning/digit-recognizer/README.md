## Digit Recognizer

**Project Description:** <br />
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, which comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. The project involves preprocessing the image data, designing and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition. This implementation demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to solve image classification problems, showcasing the effectiveness of CNNs in handling visual data.
