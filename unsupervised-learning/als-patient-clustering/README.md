## ALS Patient Clustering

**Project Description:** <br />
This project involves applying unsupervised learning techniques to the ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) dataset to uncover patterns and groupings within the data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is first used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, capturing the most significant features and enabling more efficient clustering. Subsequently, the K-means clustering algorithm is employed to identify distinct clusters within the reduced-dimensional space, potentially revealing subgroups of ALS patients with similar characteristics. The project aims to provide insights into the variations within the ALS population, which could inform further research and therapeutic strategies.
